## 18.03.2016 ##
Protocol changes:
- Initial key (pakect ID 255) changed key from 2200049715 to 154669603

## 17.03.2016 ##
Protocol changes:

Code changes:
- New event `client.on.logoutRequest` for logout packet ID `104`

## 28.02.2016 ##
Protocol changes:
- New packet ID `18` that commands to delete all known balls from memory.

Code changes:
- New destroy ball reason `server-forced` when server commands to delete all balls.

## 16.02.2016 ##
Now agar.io sends random "virtual" size map as protection from bots.
New sizes are refreshing in `client.on.mapSizeLoad` event.
When you re-spawning you should delete old balls from memory because their coordinates will be invalid. Not adding this to client's code because it can be changed by agar any time.

## 28.01.2016 ##
Now agar.io server allows only 3 connections from single IP instead of 5.

## 14.01.2016 ##
